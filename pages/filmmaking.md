text: Directed by Brahmanand Singh and edited by Irene Dhar Malik, both national award winners in India, 'Riding on a Sunbeam' explores the social, cultural, economic and religious contradictions of India in a thought-provoking, non-touristy way. It is available for streaming on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kxwiE0xdvM) in India, and on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/riding-on-a-sunbeam/id1102679745) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Riding-Sunbeam-Mauktik-Kulkarni/dp/B01C7V3HL8/ref=sr_1_1?s=instant-video&ie=UTF8&qid=1456838296&sr=1-1&keywords=Riding+On+a+SUnbeam) overseas. After a warm reception at a handful of festivals, the film has been screened at various prestigious venues, including the National Center for Performing Arts, US consulates in Mumbai & Ahmedabad, Film & Television Institute of India, New York University, India Ideas Conference at Georgetown University, Infosys Convention Center and a host of other corporate venues and cultural centers. A screening followed by Q&A is a perfect recipe for universities, team-building retreats, adventure/travel related gatherings, or organizers of cultural events looking for an intellectually stimulating and entertaining evening.

Film-making was not part of the 'plan,' but who sticks to their plans? After finishing his epic, 36-country round-the-world trip, Mauktik moved to India to explore the start-up scene. Before he knew it, his entrepreneurial instinct led him to co-produce and co-anchor a unique travel film about India titled 'Riding on a Sunbeam.'

Mauktik is currently co-producing feature film adaptation of his first book A Ghost of Che, which will be the first Indian film to be shot entirely in South America, and has 4-5 other film projects in the pipeline.
