text: Mauktik is a neuroscientist, backpacker, author, entrepreneur, public speaker and a film maker.  While he is still passionate about technology and startups, things changed a bit when he stumbled upon the world of backpacking.  After crisscrossing the world and hitting more than 50 countries, he has become a storyteller and tells tales of neuroscience, entrepreneurship, traveling, creative writing, film making and other adventures in life.  Featured in National Geographic, Mint, Times of India, The Hindu and several other publications, he routinely writes for various media outlets in English and Marathi.  He has seen successes and failures in healthcare, e-commerce and media start-ups, and often consults with start-ups and related organizations.  Before becoming a storyteller, he got a bachelors in Electronics & Telecom Engineering from Univ. of Pune, masters in Biophysics from Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and another masters in Neuroscience from the Johns Hopkins University.
